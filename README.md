# DogiJK

This only compiles on Linux and that's unlikely to change any time soon.

TODO:
1. Make a new renderer from scratch.  
	* Mostly working, just a few things left to do and iron out the occasional bug.
2. Re-add the Bullet physics engine  
	* Should be easy, I've done it before, albeit poorly.
	* Basics are in, still much left to do.
3. Add scripting engine  
	* Why do all embeddable language frameworks suck
	* Seriously there's not a single good one
	* The only remotely well programmed one is LUA, and I hate LUA
4. Implement navigation meshes
	* Look into https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation
	* Should be easy to generate for existing maps
	* Should work for both bots and NPCs (mostly NPCs)
