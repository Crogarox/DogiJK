This only compiles on Linux and that's unlikely to change any time soon.

TODO:
1. Make a new renderer from scratch.  
	• Ghoul2 has been moved outside of the renderer so this should now be fairly easy  
2. Re-add the Bullet physics engine  
	• Should be easy, I've done it before, albeit poorly.  
3. Add scripting engine  
	• Not LUA, h8 LUA  
	• Not Mono, too buggy (and massive) jesus christ
